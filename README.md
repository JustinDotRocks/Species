# Species Catalogue

## Description

Species Catalogue is a web-based interactive application that allows visitors of
Manuels River to explore and learn about various species found along its banks.
Users can discover detailed information about each species, including images,
descriptions, and habitat maps, enhancing their educational and visiting
experience.

Although this app is fully functional as a standalone tool for species
identification and learning, its integration with a REST API backend could
potentially enable features like user profiles, saving favorite species, and
more interactive and personalized experiences.

## Motivation

As frequent visitors and enthusiasts of Manuels River's natural beauty and
biodiversity, we recognized the need for an engaging tool to help both locals
and tourists appreciate the river's ecological richness. We wanted to move
beyond traditional guidebooks to offer an interactive, informative, and
accessible resource for learning about the species that inhabit this unique
environment.

## Features

- **Species Selection:** Browse through a categorized list of species found
  along Manuels River.
- **Favorites:** Mark species as favorites for easy access during future visits.
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Learn about each species with detailed descriptions
  and beautiful imagery.
